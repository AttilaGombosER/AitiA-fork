Welcome to the documentation. üê¶

[Project Homepage](https://github.com/Aitia-IIOT/sentinel-mrhat-cam)

## Overview

The device consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, a Hat by Effective-Range‚Ñ¢, a camera, a battery and a solar panel. Its function is taking pictures periodically and sending them through mqtt. The period, mode and working time is configurable by sending a config file to the device.

#### Period 
How often the images will be taken.

#### Mode
Either **one-shot** (take one picture, send it, then shut down), **always-on** (taking and sending them as fast as it can without break), and **periodic** (taking and sending pictures with a given period). In production only the **periodic** mode will be used.

About where to send the config, see the **Messaging** section.

The end product will come in a water and dust-proof case with wifi antenna and IP68 rated button, currently the prototype is in an electrical box, originally rated IP68, but a hole had to be drilled for the USB cable, so using duct tape around the area is recommended if you plan on using it in the rain.

## Login
#### Example of ssh using ip address:
Connect the device to the PC using the USB-C port on the Hat and use a program like PuTTY to communicate through serial port. Check the device manager to see which COM port the device uses. Inside PuTTY it should look like this:

![Image of PuTTY](https://github.com/bnyitrai03/rpizero_storage/blob/main/PuTTY.png?raw=true)

(On windows for the serial line just write COM...)

Baud rate: 115200

Click on Open, click inside the window and press Enter. After a while it will ask for the username and the password, during testing: 

Password: admin

Username: admin

![Image of login](https://github.com/bnyitrai03/rpizero_storage/blob/main/PuTTY_Login.png?raw=true)

Write hostname -I, and you will get the ip address.

![Hostname](https://github.com/bnyitrai03/rpizero_storage/blob/main/PuTTY_Hostname.png?raw=true)

You can now log in using this ip address like so:

```bash
ssh admin@192.168.0.103
```

#### Example of ssh using mDNS:

Once you have successfully connected to the device you will know its name, you can also use this to log in, you just have to put .local after the name.
```bash
ssh admin@er-edge-16b9ac84.local
```

#### Example of ssh using [key based login](https://github.com/EffectiveRange/devc-effectiverange/wiki/Configuring-SSH-targets):
In the linked tutorial the name the Host myhost, you can name it however you like.
```bash
ssh myhost
```

## Running the script

By default the script is running automatically as soon as the device has booted up. This is thanks to a daemon, which is starting a bash script on boot. The bash script starts the python script, handles additional logging, and restarts the script or the device based on exit codes from the python script.

If you dont want the script to start on boot, then you have to disable the daemon responsible for that.

```bash
sudo systemctl disable sentinel_mrhat_cam.service

sudo reboot
```

To make it start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sentinel_mrhat_cam.service

sudo reboot
```

You can also start the script manually.

Make sure you are in the home/admin folder.
```bash
cd
```
Then run the bash script.
```bash
bash sentinel_mrhat_cam.sh
```

As its running itt will create a bash_log.txt and a hardware_log.txt file in the home/admin folder on the Pi. The bash_log contains information about whats happening within the script and the hardware_log, as the name suggests lets us know about specifics of the hardware, like CPU temperature and battery voltage... 

If for some reason you want to run the python script straight up, you can do that too.
```bash
python3 -m sentinel_mrhat_cam.main
```

Be aware, that this way you will miss out on the bash_log and the hardware_log, it will also not handle the cases where the script exits with an exit code.


## Power management

Currently, if you want to charge the battery you have to first fully disconnect the power (no USB cable, no battery connected), and then first connect the battery and then plug in the USB cable. The order matters here!

Alternatively, you can shut down the device with the following command:
```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```
The green LED on the Raspberry (not the HAT!) will blink 10 times (can take a bit of time for it to start blinking), it will shut down after. Once it has fully shut down **pressing the button** will wake it up, and if the USB cable and the battery are both connected it will be charging.(TODO, insert picture of button)

In case of the button malfunctioning, simply pull out and plug in the USB cable.

#### Meaning of LED-s
The green LED on the Raspberry shows whether its on or off.
On the HAT there are 3 LED-s. If one blue LED is on, then it means its running off of the battery. If two blue LED-s are on, it means that it receives power through the USB-C port.
The green LED on the HAT is on, if the battery is being charged.
